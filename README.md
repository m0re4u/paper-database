# Paper Database

A repository of some of the papers I read/find during my PhD project.

## Content description
- `papers.bib`: a bibtex file, kept up to date with [JabRef](https://www.jabref.org/) or manually.
- `exported/`: a directory of exported Markdown lists of papers, for external use.
- `custom_export/`: a directory containing custom JabRef export layouts.
- `export.py`: a python file that converts bibtex entries to markdown format.
- `[export/deploy].sh`: shortcut scripts for exporting and deploying.
