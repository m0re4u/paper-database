Our results show that MTL performs particularly well (and better than single-task learning) when little training data is available for the main task, a common scenario in AM. Our findings challenge previous assumptions that conceptualizations across AM datasets are divergent and that MTL is difficult for semantic or higher-level tasks.},

  abstract    = {Attention mechanisms have seen some success for natural language processing downstream tasks in recent years and generated new State-of-the-Art results. A thorough evaluation of the attention mechanism for the task of Argumentation Mining is missing, though. With this paper, we report a comparative evaluation of attention layers in combination with a bidirectional long short-term memory network, which is the current state-of-the-art approach to the unit segmentation task. We also compare sentence-level contextualized word embeddings to pre-generated ones. Our findings suggest that for this task the additional attention layer does not improve upon a less complex approach. In most cases, the contextualized embeddings do also not show an improvement on the baseline score.},
